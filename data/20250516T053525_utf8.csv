Got it! Here's the refined approach we'll take:
1. Prompt (General): We'll keep this as-is. Itâ€™s solid and captures the essence you're going for.

2. Prompt (Refining): We'll start fresh to ensure consistency, clarity, and completeness. This will
focus on specific refinements like lighting, contrast, texture, and positioning to ensure each
animal's characteristics are visually distinct. We'll also account for feedback, like ensuring

animals with dark or black tones (e.g., Panther) have sufficient contrast for clarity.

3. Prompt (Augmenting): These will be for suggested improvements or adjustments once we've
got the refining portion right. For example, we'd specify how contrast and color should evolve

for animals like the Panther to enhance visibility and overall aesthetics.
