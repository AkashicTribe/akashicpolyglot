I. Executive Summary of Harm

The following itemized breakdown represents a complete, forensic-level summary completed by Jacob and his legal
counsel which exhaustively presents and indicates provable harm incurred by Jacob Marvin Welker during his
employment with Performance Staffing LLC (Super T Transport, BLNA Assets, Berger Logistics, Berger Logistiks,
Berger NA, Berger Austria, etc....it’s very unclear as to who I work for. I was hired by Super T Transport, but all of
my paperwork shows Berger Logistics, and Performance Staffing is the the one paying my paychecks. Look into this
madness and see how it helps us open new and interesting fox paths forward).( These damages are financial,
emotional, legal, tax-burdened, and career-altering in scope. This document integrates all confirmed records, including
W-2 filings, paystubs, tax settings, retirement contributions, time-off logs, Paylocity, profile findings, legal
ramifications and fees incurred with State and Federal agencies, as well as but not limited to ongoing and egregious
documented managerial misconduct in direct legal opposition and conflict with regularly accepted workplace
conditions and business ethics minimal acceptable standards respectively.

- Stay Bonus (Contractual): **$4,333.33** unpaid (confirmed)

- Insurance Premiums Deducted Without Coverage: **$525.00** (pretty sure these are included in the calculation for
the reimbursement total, unless my calculations are incorrect.)

- Legal Fees Incurred (as of May 14, 2025): **$1,047.00**(legal fees

- Rent Late Fees: **$475.00**

- Emotional Damages (minimum good-faith basis): **$5,000.00**

**Total Revised Counter Proposal: $14,598.90 — $16,098.90**

III. Structural Failures and Violations

1. **Wage Classification Discrepancy**: Switched from hourly to salary without consent or FLSA exemption
notice.m (-$202.17 - Shawn pushed to Ally, Ally pushed to my account last week or so, this was because Salary
kicked in vs Hourly in April, one pay cycle earlier, in error, egregiously, as well as not being calculated based off of
my annual salary, that’s what the 202.17 is, the correcting OT pay from the end of April, this amount won’t effect the
reimbursement amount stated in JJa above.)

2. **PTO Withholding**: Accrued over 55 hours, yet work continued without relief or payout.

3. **Unauthorized Deduction of Medical Premiums**: Confirmed by Paylocity. (Semisi and Melissa at Paylocity
confirmed I had active coverage for all of January and February but nothing before that and nothing after that. No
premiums should have been taken out in March or April or May of 2025 nor Dec of 2024 nor Nov of 2024 nor Oct of
2025.)

4. **Trapped Retirement Contributions**: $1,336.85 subject to taxation due to employer-induced hardship. (I in good
faith have been doing maximum allowed employee contributions despite lack of reimbursement, don’t want my hard-
sought retirement account leached onto and drained in fees, need compensation for fees invoked due to early
withdrawal reimbursed or be allowed to draw out penalty free due to employer-egregious-error, etc.)

5. **Absence of Expense Logging**: Despite out-of-pocket legal & garnishment fees, Paylocity shows no
reimbursements filed. (All reimbursements have been run through outside of Paylggity historically, don’t get too
worked up about this)

6. **Direct Deposit Diversion**: 3 bank accounts split with no record of employee-signed allocation forms.

7. **Retaliation via PTO Denial and Communication During Crisis**: All logged and HR-reviewed.

IV. Federal and State Law Exposure

- **FLSA**: Salary status without exemption.

- **]RS**: Wage misreporting potential on W-2.

- **ERISA**: Failure to manage retirement plan in good faith.

- **NLRA**: Gag clauses and isolating behavior against employee.
- **Idaho DOL**: Denial of PTO, coercive reimbursement delays.
- **HIPAA/Ethics**: Harassment during dependent medical crisis.

V. Terms of Fair and Permanent Resolution

The following corrective steps are proposed:

¢ Payment of full $14,598.90+ by Friday COB via direct deposit
e Written acknowledgment of Stay Bonus and tax exposures

¢ Clear statement releasing employee of all fault

¢ All gag, indemnity, and liability waivers removed

¢ No interference with future claims under federal law

* Confirmation of closure of all accounts and logs
