<p>Chiron Sung HK (昭源宋體) is a Traditional Chinese serif typeface based on Adobe's Source Han Serif (branded as Noto Serif CJK by Google). The font aims to provide a modern, region-agnostic glyph set that adopts the “modern” glyph style similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in Traditional Chinese regions.</p>


<p>In Chiron Sung HK, glyph shapes in Source Han Serif Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) are reviewed and adjusted for the better display effect on screen and in print. The font takes references from the glyph shapes of typefaces commonly seen in daily life to provide a set of regional agnostic, modern-style glyphs that balance standard glyph shapes and the usual stroke forms of printed typefaces. The glyph set is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese communities.</p>
